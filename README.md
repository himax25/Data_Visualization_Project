# Data_Visualization_Project
This is one of data visualization projects in Data Science Nanodegree program at Udatcity. 
Base on the information which came from a Kaggle dataset, it tracked the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. 
I created three virtualizations in Tableau with my insight as the followings.

## Insight 1
The below map is the information about flight's arrival delays in 2015 by each Airport at US with Airlines.
* It showed that the worst arrival delay airport at US in 2015 was Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (17,877 times arrival delays).
* DL airline has 11,508 arrival delay times at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2015 as the 1st worst rank of the total number of arrival delay airlines at each airport in US.

## Insight 2
The following visualization chart showed that the major causes of flight delays on the day of Week, filtered by either airport or airline. 
* There are 8 major causes for flight delays in this chart; Airline delay, Air System delay, Departure delay, Diverted, Late Aircraft delay, Security delay, and Whether delay. All 8 major causes’ counters tell us that the 6th day of week is the least flight delay day in the week.
