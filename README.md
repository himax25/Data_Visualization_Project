# Data_Visualization_Project
This is one of data visualization projects in Data Science Nanodegree program at Udatcity. 
Base on the information which came from a Kaggle dataset, it tracked the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. 
I created three visualizations in Tableau with my insight as the followings.

## Insight 1
The below map is the information about flight's arrival delays in 2015 by each Airport at US with Airlines.
* It showed that the worst arrival delay airport at US in 2015 was Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (17,877 times arrival delays).
* DL airline has 11,508 arrival delay times at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2015 as the 1st worst rank of the total number of arrival delay airlines at each airport in US.

## Insight 2
The following visualization chart showed that the major causes of flight delays on the day of Week, filtered by either airport or airline. 
* There are 8 major causes for flight delays in this chart; Airline delay, Air System delay, Departure delay, Diverted, Late Aircraft delay, Security delay, and Whether delay. All 8 major causes’ counters tell us that the 6th day of week is the least flight delay day in the week.

## Insight 3
The following visualization chart is for Airline information for the most frequently arrival delays with cancelled at most US domestic airports in 2015. 
* There are 14 airlines to carry out US domestic flights in 2015.  Among of them, WN(Southwest) Airline has the worst records; 58,438 arrival delays and 59,437 flight cancellation from US domestic airports as No. 1 lowest performing domestic airline.

# Conclusion
The below Dashboard visualization chart is about the insights of US domestic flights and airports operation related data sets. we are able to find out three major insights from this visualization dashboard regarding flights’ arrival delays at major US domestic airports & airlines with major causes.
