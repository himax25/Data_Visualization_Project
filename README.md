# Data_Visualization_Project
This is one of data visualization projects in Data Science Nanodegree program at Udatcity. 
Base on the information which came from a Kaggle dataset, it tracked the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. 
I created three virtualizations in Tableau with my insight as the followings.

## Insight 1
The below map is the information about flight's arrival delays in 2015 by each Airport at US with Airlines.
* It showed that the worst arrival delay airport at US in 2015 was Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (17,877 times arrival delays).
* DL airline has 11,508 arrival delay times at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2015 as the 1st worst rank of the total number of arrival delay airlines at each airport in US.
